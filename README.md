# NavigationRouter
An alternative for SwiftUI NavigationStack. While using the NavigationStack for performance, NavigationRouter gives more control to navigating. It also gives easy access for programatic navigation.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler: open Xcode, click on `File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package dependency...` and use the repository URL (https://github.com/Lukas-Simonson/SwiftUI-Navigation-Router.git) to download the package.

In Xcode, when you are prompted for a Version or a Branch, we suggest you use the branch: main
If you need, or want to try some experimental features, you can use the branch: dev

Then in your View you just need to import NavigationRouter
